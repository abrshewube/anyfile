# AnyFile Core v0.1.0 – Project Overview

## Project Name
- `AnyFile`

## Version
- `0.1.0` (Core Foundation preview)

## Scope
- Establish the universal foundation for file handling operations that downstream modules—Excel, PDF, Word, CSV, and more—extend.
- Define the base API shape, type definitions, and extensibility points needed by all future AnyFile packages.

## Goal
- Deliver a lightweight, type-safe, and consistent API that developers can rely on when working with any kind of file through modular packages under the `@anyfile/*` namespace.
- Provide a cohesive developer experience that hides format-specific complexity behind a unified contract.
